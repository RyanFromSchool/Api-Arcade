# Api-Arcade
This is going to be the central repository for the Elon Musketeers.
To get started and establish a workflow, try adding your name to this readme page (but don't edit it in github!).

### A normal workflow would look like this:
1) Clone repository to your local machine
2) Create a new branch and call it &lt;your name&gt;
3) While on your new branch, edit the readme file and add your name
4) Stage changes
5) Commit changes
6) Push branch to github repository
7) Create a pull request to merge you changes
  
### Commands to accomplish the above steps
(INSTALL GIT ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE BEFORE DOING THIS)
1) from the command line, navigate to the directory you wish to clone into (I just use the Desktop)
2) run `git clone https://github.com/andykawabata/Api-Arcade.git` to clone the repository
3) run `cd Api-Arcade` to go into the repo you just cloned
4) run `git checkout -b <your name>` to create a branch called &lt;your name&gt; (you're automaticly on your new branch after you do this)
5) add your name to the readme file and save it
6) run `git add .` to stage your changes
7) run `git commit -m"added name to readme"` to commit changes
8) run `git push -u origin <your name>` to push your branch to github
9) go to the repo on github and click "comapre and pull request"
